						<h1>Solution</h1>
						<p>After gathering all of our research, we determined the primary call-to-action of the website home page, and also create a style tile.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Call to action</h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/CTA.png" alt="" /></span></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>I made "Donate Now" my main Call to Action for the Open Door Children's Home's website. After my interview with Amy Cox, I realized that receiving donations, both item and financial, is the most important purpose of the website. The CTA needed to provide users a clear and easy way to give to the ODCH.</p>
						<p>After learning more about how different users use the website I realized the secondary Call to Action would be "Volunteer". The ODCH provides many opportunities for people to come and support the Home, whether it be making improvements around the Home, interacting with or driving the children, or even cooking the children and house parents a meal. These opportunities are currently not being displayed in a way that users can overlook. Creating a secondary CTA button with this purpose can solve this issue and connect more people to the children and needs of the ODCH.</p>

					<h2>Style Tile</h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u1"><p>We created a style tile, or a combination of a mood board and a mock up, that features main elements of the website's design such as color, type, and Call to Action buttons to communicate the feel of the organization.</p></div>
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Edited Style Tile Final.jpg" alt="" style="border: 1px solid #cccccc;" /></span></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>My style tile hopes to communicate the Open Door Children's Home as inviting, friendly, organized, youthful, and warm. I chose these adjectives based on the goals of the Home, by interview with Mrs. Cox, and my research of other Children's Homes. I chose the typeface Avenir for my header, subheader, and body copy to convey a modern but welcoming feeling to the community members and case workers who would be visiting the website.</p>
					  <p>The combination of a navy blue, teal blue, and a bright orange gives a friendly but also organized feel for the organization. The Call to Action in a button paired with an image offers an example of what the website's main page could look like to create a put-together and welcoming feeling.</p>
