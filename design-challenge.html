						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
					</header>
					<p>I chose the organization Open Door Children's Home, an organization located in my hometown of Rome, Georgia. The Home focuses on children whose parents are unable to take care of them, who have experienced trauma or abuse, and even siblings in the foster care system who do not wish to be split up.</p>
