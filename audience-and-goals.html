						<h1>Determine Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p>After conducting research, we focused on finding the website's specific audience and cooresponding goals.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Audience</h2>
					<p>This part of the research was about determining our target audiences. We began with a broad approach and then narrowed down to the most effected audience, all while using lots of sticky notes.</p>
					<!-- The class called "row" is called so that we can use the column classes (4u, 8u, etc) in the divs inside. -->
					<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Audience/Overall Audience.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>We first looked at the main audience and think of all the people who might possibly visit the website. I focused on those who need help, those who could help, and those who might be opposed or competitors of the organization.</p></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Audience/Those Who Can Help.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>I then focused more on who could help, and placed them in different subcategories based on how they might effect the organization. I divided the notes up into those who are involved or are a part of the Open Door Children's Home, those that would offer donations, and those that would volunteer time or services.</p></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Audience/Those Who Need Help.jpg" alt="audience notes" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>I finally narrowed down the audience to those who know or are effected by a child who is experiencing a number of issues that could cause them to need a more stable home environment.</p></div>

					<h3>Goals Conclusions</h3>
					<p>After these exercises, I finally narrowed down the main goals of the ODCH is to spread awareness about the organization while also increasing the number of financial and item donations. The audience's goals of the website are to learn more about the organization's services as well as volunteer, mentor, or donate. The website has the task of presenting these opportunites, as well as display any information about the ODCH, any fundraisers, or recent needs of the children.</p>

					<p>These main goals and content are based on my interview with Amy Cox and the content that is currently shown on the ODCH website. The main task will be discovering how to display information about the organization so that it is clear as well as making volunteer and donation opportunities more visible.</p>
