						<h1>Research</h1>
						<p class="info">The next step was research about the Open Door Children's Home that included primary research on the organization, secondary research, and even interviews with important members.</p>
					</header>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Open Door Home Research/Open Door Home Website Home Page 2.png" alt="" style="border: 1px solid rgba(144, 144, 144, 0.025);" /></span><h2>Primary Client Research</h2>The Open Door Children's Home (ODCH) main goal is to provide needs for dependent, abused, and/or neglected children in the Northwest Georgia area to help give them and inspire them to live better lives. The Home offers different options to volunteer, give, and impact to improve the children of the Home's lives. The Open Door Home's goals can be achieved by offering volunteer services and options to donate items and meet financial needs.</p>
					<p>The website explains the many different services the ODCH provides, including offering basic needs like food and clothing, a nurturing environment, health services, and an emphasis on academics. The ODCH also hosts local fundraisers and events, such as golf tournaments and lemonade stands, to raise awareness and play a role in the community, as well as raise awareness about basic needs and improvements for the Home.</p>
					<p>The ODCH seems to do most of their marketing and advertising through Facebook or local events, as the Home will post their needs or events on the social media site or spread the word by employees or volunteers. This way of marketing could be one factor to the limited awareness and financial donations needed for the Home.</p>

						<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
					</header>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Open Door Home News/Open Door Home News- More Kids 1.png" alt="" style="border: 1px solid rgba(144, 144, 144, 0.025);" /></span><h3>Recent News</h3>In August 2017, the ODCH was featured in the local newspaper, Rome News Tribune, for taking in children with behavioral needs. The Home's current administration revealed that while these children had more needs, they are glad that they have a home at Open Door. The article also revealed the Home's need for more funds to use toward the Home and the children. A local lemonade and cookies stand run by a young boy raises money for the Home, but more donations were needed. This shows that the Home's current way of promoting the need for donations is not very effective, and the website might be a contributing factor.</p>

					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Open Door Home Research/Open Door Home Facebook page copy.png" alt="" style="border: 1px solid rgba(144, 144, 144, 0.025);" /></span><h3>Social Media</h3>I noticed the ODCH has a Facebook page with a prevalent following, and is actually more updated and current than their website. The page features posts about fundaraisers for the Home, including an Annual Clubs and Clays Fundraiser and a local Lemondade and Cookie stand, as well as images of donors of the Home. The page also includes special events or activities the children participate in, to display the welcoming and family-like environment of the ODCH. Photos and links to certain items that are needed are also posted to the page in order to keep recent needs known and current. The Home even posts any open positions at the Home, including an Executive Director position, and include a link to the job description and application.</p>

					  <p>This organization focuses on helping children that are in need of a safe home environment, those that are homeless, and people who need addiction recovery services. The main home page of the website features a clear and eye-catching call to action, along with a video playing behing demonstrating the different services they specialize in. The home page also features an arrow leading the viewer to scroll through the rest of the page, a navigation bar with clear and concise tabs, and a bolded donate button at the top of the page.</p>
						<p>The rest of the website features innovative elements that could be incorporated into the Open Door Home's website including:
							<ul>
								<li>Updated counter that keeps track of the different services the organization has completed for the community</li>
								<li>Add to Impact button as an ingruiging alternative to Donate</li>
								<li>Clear Who We Are statement to explain the organization and a What We Believe option to interest the viewer to click through the site</li>
								<li>Images of staff members and descriptions of who they are and the roles they contribute to the organization</li>
							  <li>Clear home page with images of the homes that are part of the organization as well as a description about what they do</li>
								<li>Photos of the children's home location on Google maps</li>
								<li>Address, phone, and capacity services information in clear and readable type</li>
								<li>Image of the children's home director with his name and information, presenting the home as a friendly and welcoming environment</li>
							</ul>
					<span class="image right"><img src="images/Web-Comparison website/Calvary/Comparison site-Calvary donate items page.png" alt="" style="border: 1px solid rgba(144, 144, 144, 0.025);" /></span><h3>Calvary Home</h3>
					  <p>Another organization that featured many elements that were clever and useful was the Calvary Home. This organization is similar to the Open Door Home in that they provide a secure home life and services to kids in need. Some key features from this website include:</p>
						  <ul>
							  <li>A subscribe and Talk option to submit any questions or to receive any updates about the organization</li>
								<li>Take Action page with 3 options to participate to either volunteer, donate or organize a drive, or be an advocate. The options are listed in 3 columns, differentiating the options making the information easy to read</li>
								<li>The Donation page divides the types of donations into 4 categories, Food, Household, Cleaning, and Clothes, to make donating different items clearer</li>
								<li>Donation page also links to an Amazon wishlist, providing a list of goods the organization requested on Amazon, making donating faster and easier</li>

					    <h2>Interviews</h2>
				    </header>
						<p>For my interviews I was able to contact Amy Cox, chairman for the Open Door Children's Home via phone call. She was kind enough to offer honest answers about the Home and how the website currently functions. I was also able to contact three website users through Facebook messaging. I found these users by looking at who followed or liked the page, and they all offered interesting connections to the Home.</p>
				<h3>Open Door Children's Home Employee</h3>
				    <p><a href="images/Open Door Home Interview.pdf" target="_blank">This interview </a> was with chairman Amy Cox. I asked her a variety of questions about the ODCH including what the Home is, certain goals for the organization, the website's target audience, and specific questions about the function and design of the current website.</p>
						<p>My interview with Mrs. Cox allowed me to understand not only the Open Door Children's Home better, but also the message and goals behind it. I learned that the website needed to provide clearer volunteer and donate opportunites with a new and updated design in order to increase the number of donated items and funds and website users.</p>
				<h3>Website Users</h3>
				    <p>I asked website users questions ranging from how they came to know or even become envolved with the ODCH, how the user experience was, if they were able to find what they were looking for, and any suggestions they had on how the website could be improved.</p>
				    <p>I interviewed Pebbles Wheeler, a local primary school teacher, Erica Jones, whose father was a part of the ODCH when he was young, and Whitney-Faith Smith, a recent college graduate who donated to the Home in the past. All three users expressed that they are very interested in and love the ODCH's purpose of helping children that are at a disadvantage. The main similarity I found in their answers was the fact that the website is not very appealing and could use some updating. The lack of an inviting image or clear type left the users with a feeling of blandness rather than welcoming. One response that interested me was from Mrs. Wheeler as she explained that when she refers people to the website, they end up going to Open Door, a website for those who are interested in buying or selling their homes. This discrepency I believe is from the variation of the ODCH's actual title, as some refer to it as the Open Door when when the actual title is Open Door Children's Home. Another intriguing part from Mrs. Wheeler's response was that people often ask if the Home is located in the city of Rome, Georgia. The lack of any local historical markings or even a photo of the Home's location on Google Maps makes users confused about the Home and where it is actually located.</p>
				    <p>I discovered that the users most commonly go to the website to look for updated volunteer opportunites or learn more about any donations that are needed. These searches line up with the website's main goals of providing volunteer and donation opportunites as well as informing the community about the ODCH. After interviewing various users, I knew that the ODCH's website needed to have more attractive graphics, typography, and layout. The website also needed to have updated events and volunteer opportunites, as well as local elements or landmarks to make users aware of the Home's location.</p>
