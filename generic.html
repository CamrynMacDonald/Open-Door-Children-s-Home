					<h3>Recent News</h3>
					<p>In August 2017, the Open Door Home was featured in the local newspaper, Rome News Tribune, for welcoming in children with behavioral needs. The Home's 'administration' revealed that while these children had more needs, they are glad that they have a home at Open Door. The article also revealed the Home's need for more funds to use toward the Home and the children. A local lemonade and cookies stand run by a young boy raises money for the Home 'every year', but more donations were needed.</p>
					<h3>Social Media</h3>
					<p>The Open Door Home has a prevalent following on Facebook, and features recent posts about any events or updates about the Home. The Facebook page features photos of donors, recent fundraisers, and any recent needs of the Home.</p>
