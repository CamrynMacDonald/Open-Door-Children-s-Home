						<h1>Research</h1>
						<p class="info">I conducted research on the Open Door Children's Home that included primary research on the organization, secondary research on news and similar organizations, and even interviews with important members.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Primary Client Research</h2>
					<p>The Open Door Children's Home main goal is to provide needs for dependent, abused, and/or neglected children in the Northwest Georgia area to help give them and inspire them to live better lives. The Home offers different options to volunteer, give, and impact to improve the children of the Home's lives. The Open Door Home's goals can be achieved by offering volunteer services and options to donate items and meet financial needs.</p>
					<p>The website explains the many different services the Open Door Home provides, including offering basic needs like food and clothing, a nurturing environment, health services, and an emphasis on academics. The Open Door Home also hosts many fundraisers and events, such as golf tournaments and lemonade stands, to raise awareness and financial donations for basic needs and improvements for the Home.</p>

						<h2>Secondary Research</h2>
					</header>
					<h3>Recent News</h3>
					  <p>In August 2017, the Open Door Home was featured in the local newspaper, Rome News Tribune, for taking in children with behavioral needs. The Home's 'administration' revealed that while these children had more needs, they are glad that they have a home at Open Door. The article also revealed the Home's need for more funds to use toward the Home and the children. A local lemonade and cookies stand run by a young boy raises money for the Home 'every year', but more donations were needed.</p>
					<h3>Social Media</h3>
					  <p>The Open Door Home has a prevalent following on Facebook, and features recent posts about any events or updates about the Home. The Facebook page features photos of donors, recent fundraisers, and any recent needs of the Home.</p>
					<h3>Miracle Hill Ministries</h3>
					  <p>This organization focuses on helping children that are in need of a safe home environment, those that are homeless, and people who need addiction recovery services. The main home page of the website features a clear and eye-catching call to action, along with a video playing behing demonstrating the different services they specialize in. The home page also features an arrow leading the viewer to scroll through the rest of the page, a navigation bar with clear and concise tabs, and a bolded donate button at the top of the page.</p>
						<p>The rest of the website features innovative elements that could be incorporated into the Open Door Home's website including:
							<ul>
								<li>Updated counter that keeps track of the different services the organization has completed for the community</li>
								<li>Add to Impact button as an ingruiging alternative to Donate</li>
								<li>Clear Who We Are statement to explain the organization and a What We Believe option to interest the viewer to click through the site</li>
								<li>Images of staff members and descriptions of who they are and the roles they contribute to the organization</li>
							  <li>Clear home page with images of the homes that are part of the organization as well as a description about what they do</li>
								<li>Photos of the children's home location on Google maps</li>
								<li>Address, phone, and capacity services information in clear and readable type</li>
								<li>Image of the children's home director with his name and information, presenting the home as a friendly and welcoming environment</li>
							</ul>
					<h3>Calvary Home</h3>
					  <p>Another organization that featured many elements that were clever and useful was the Calvary Home. This organization is similar to the Open Door Home in that they provide a secure home life and services to kids in need. Some key features from this website include:</p>
						  <ul>
							  <li>A subscribe and Talk option to submit any questions or to receive any updates about the organization</li>
								<li>Take Action page with 3 options to participate to either volunteer, donate or organize a drive, or be an advocate. The options are listed in 3 columns, differentiating the options making the information easy to read</li>
								<li>The Donation page divides the types of donations into 4 categories, Food, Household, Cleaning, and Clothes, to make donating different items clearer</li>
								<li>Donation page also links to an Amazon wishlist, providing a list of goods the organization requested on Amazon, making donating faster and easier</li>
							</ul>
